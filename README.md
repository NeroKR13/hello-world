## Project Log
### 10/26/2017
We discussed how we would work as a team and started learning about Git, Github and Markdown. We also verified we both understood related concepts and had everything installed. 

During the next session, we will start coding the actual API. @nerokr13 will be the main driver and @arwym the main observer, considering here that @arwym has the most experience. We will still switch roles at some points in each session.
